                        &emsp;&emsp;IDEA is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization incorporated under the Nonprofit Law of the state of California that seeks to educate individuals on all aspects of the business world. IDEA stands for Innovative Development for Entrepreneurs Association, and the organization's primary focus is to provide the world's youth with the tools to succeed in the business world, especially as entrepreneurs. IDEA employs experienced high school students to teach classes in a variety of subjects essential to the flourishing business world today. 
                        <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;While IDEA was started to teach entrepreneurship, the high demand for its programs around the nation caused it to expand to other subjects such as Computer Aided Design and coding. Since its inception, IDEA has expanded to several states and countries around the world. We are currently developing an online platform to cater to thousands more internationally.
                        <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;We are currently looking to start an internship at IDEA in which students can serve one of four roles: as teachers to underprivileged students, as members of our expansion and administration team, as members of our student recruitment team, or as members of our programming team. All interns will earn volunteering hours for their service. 
                        <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;IDEA's teachers will be essential to the organization's success. Teachers will be responsible for creating their own courses in any subject of their interest. They can either adopt one of IDEA's curricula or create curricula of their own (pending the approval of a professional in the field of the course and of the IDEA board). Teachers will develop presentations, prepare engaging activities, and show up to educational institutions such as libraries to teach classes.
                        <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;In order for an organization to increase its impact, it must also increase its size. IDEA has been quickly catching on across the country, and even the world! To increase IDEA's impact in the world, we have created the expansion team - a team whose sole role will be to expand the organization's reach around the world. Expansion has two components: venture expansion and branch expansion. Venture expansion involves contacting organizations and educational institutions around the world to get them to host IDEA's classes. We have been recently exploring offering courses in homeless shelters and at schools (as part of their regular curricula) as well. Branch expansion involves establishing IDEA clubs and chapters in schools and communities around the world. Both forms of expansion should be interconnected: if a new branch is started in a region, it is important to secure teaching locations for that branch, and vice-versa. Interns serving as members of the expansion team will contact institutions and people around the world to expand IDEA in both expansion forms.   
                     </p>
                     <p class="collapse" id="block-id">  
                        &emsp;&emsp;Members of the recruitment team would be responsible for recruiting students to IDEA's classes around the world. Recruitment interns would ideally be experienced in marketing and promotion, as these skills may be extremely useful in recruitment practices. 
                        <br> 
                        &emsp;&emsp;Lastly, members of IDEA's programming team would be working on updating IDEA's website (www.gobeyondidea.com) and developing its innovative online platform (more information will be sent out to interested members). If coding or website development is your thing, please consider joining the IDEA programming team! 
                        <br> 
                        &emsp;&emsp;Being an intern at IDEA would be ideal for many high school students looking for internships because it is a unique and impactful opportunity in our community. Interns could serve during the school year or during the summer. Though our website is currently going through massive updates, potential interns can contact us through www.gobeyondidea.com or thinkbeyondidea@gmail.com. We are currently working on securing a company email so that it will be easier to contact us.
